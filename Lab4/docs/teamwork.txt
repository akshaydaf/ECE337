2. Ayush worked a lot on the state transition diagrams and also the rtl diagrams, and Anirudh helped with the state transition diagrams and explained certain parts of the lab that did not make sense to me and Ayush.

3. We met 3 times during the prior week in order to complete the lab. We always messaged eachother before we came to the lab.

4. I worked on the rtl diagrams and state transition diagrams, as well as tried to figure out how the timer was supposed to function. 

5. The collaborater that helped me the most with this lab was a student named Peter, who through talking through the timer module, helped me figure out what we needed to incorporate into it.

6. I did not view anyones testbench code on Piazza, I looked through the previous testbench and added test cases that I thought would be useful to test in the testbench.
